py-expander
===========

A python script designed to post-process Transmission torrents.

Currently it supports 7-Zip only. So get it if you dont have it!

The script extracts files recursively (if extract is necessary..) 
and the moves the files to pre-configured folders based on their type!
if no rars are present in the download - the script will copy the files.

The script relies on standard torrent names (such as SxxExx TV shows numbering)
so I reccomend downloading torrents from private trackers if possible!

In any case - original torrent files are conserved for upload.

I recommend using this script with couchpotato/sickbeard/headphones since they 
provide additional awesome post-processing features!
