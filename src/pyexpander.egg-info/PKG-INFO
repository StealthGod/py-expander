        ===========
        
        A python script designed to post-process Transmission torrents.
        
        Currently it supports 7-Zip only. So get it if you dont have it!
        
        The script extracts files recursively (if extract is necessary..) 
        and the moves the files to pre-configured folders based on their type!
        if no rars are present in the download - the script will copy the files.
        
        The script relies on scene torrent naming standards (such as SxxExx TV shows numbering)
        
        In any case - original torrent files are conserved for upload.
        
        I recommend using this script with couchpotato/sickbeard/headphones since they 
        provide additional awesome post-processing features!
